<h2>
<br>This game is almost an exact copy of Chess. But it isn't. As the title explains, there is a "Twist" to this game:<br>
<br>1. The Chessboard: Remember the right to organize a good pawn structure to defend the more important pieces? We don't do that here. The pieces are scattered, so you have to work with a random pawn structure with random pieces scattered everywhere. Good luck with that...<br>
<br>2. Capturing Pieces: Be careful of who you capture. The piece you use to capture another piece turns into the captured piece...<br>
<br>3. Goal: The object of the game is still the same. Checkmate the opponent's king (threaten the king with capture on all open spaces) to win!<br>
